        <h1>Programming Roadmap</h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Want to learn how to code? Welcome to this web page where I will guide you through.
            Before you start, you will need a lot of patient to learn how to code, some people
            might disagree with me on this, but speaking from experience, you will need a lot of
            patient to complete a project whether it is a small project or huge project. It will
            take time.
        </p>

        <h2>Programming Language</h2>
        <p>
            There are many programming language, picking them will be messy. This happens to everyone
            at the start so dont worry.
        </p>

            Now this looks intimidating doesnt it?
        </p>

        <h2>Picking Your Language</h2>
        <p>
            Now picking your language is very messy, you dont know what or which to pick,
            you dont know which is best, you dont know which is best for you or your career.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, from what I would suggest is just pick one that interest you the most. Why?
            Simple, The thing is learning one of them can help you a lot in understanding how
            programming or coding works. Even though they all works in a different way, but
            the way they works are similar. Therefore, after learning one of them, you do not need
            struggle on learning another one. Once you learned one, moving to another language will
            make you realise that, you can compare to the first one you learn which will speed up
            your progress.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>For example: </p>
        <p>C++</p>
        <div class="code-container">
            <pre><code id="code-block">

                void greet(string name){
                    cout << "Hello " << name;
                }
    
                int main() {
                    greet("John");
                    return 0;
                }
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>Python</p>
        <div class="code-container">
            <pre><code id="code-block">
                def greet(name):
                    return print("Hello " + name)

                print(greet("John"))
            </code></pre>
        </div>
        <br>

        <p>
            As you can see, they are not similar but they do have the same idea on how to
            create a function. In C++, to create a greet function, you first declare its
            return data type, what is return data type you ask. Well, return data type is
            basically what the function will return in the end, for example if I declare it
            as Integer(int), after function call, the return value will be integer ONLY. Returning
            any other data type will cause an error. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As for python, you do not need to declare any data type. This is due to Python
            automatically assign data type. It is same as how you declare a new variable and
            assigning a value to it. Python will auto assign the data type based on the value 
            you assign to it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now dont get panic about the above example, take a step back and break it down slowly.
            Remember the journey is long, even if you are walking, you will still reach your destination.
            That is if you still walking.
        </p>
